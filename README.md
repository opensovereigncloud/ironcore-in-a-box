## Overview

**IronCore in a Box** is a project that brings up the IronCore stack inside a local [kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) cluster. It provides a local demo environment to illustrate the capabilities of IronCore.

This project supports **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows (via WSL2)** environments.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before running the project:

* [curl](https://curl.se/)
* [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [go](https://go.dev/)
* [docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [podman](https://podman.io/)

### Linux Kernel Requirements

IronCore relies on specific Linux kernel features. Ensure your kernel has the following configurations enabled, at least as modules (=m):

* CONFIG_LWTUNNEL
* CONFIG_LWTUNNEL_BPF
* CONFIG_IPV6_TUNNEL

Most modern Linux distributions have these enabled by default. However, minimal installations or older versions might require a custom kernel build or module loading.

### Windows/WSL2 Requirements

**Important for Windows/WSL2 Users** 

The default WSL2 kernel often lacks the Linux options. You will likely need to compile a custom kernel. Please ensure you have followed the [WSL2 Custom Kernel Guide](docs/windows_wsl2_kernel.md) *before* proceeding with the installation if the required kernel modules are missing.

### MacOS Requirements

When using docker, you cannot directly connect to container IPs attached to the docker network bridge. [docker-mac-net-connect](https://github.com/chipmk/docker-mac-net-connect) is a lightweight service daemon based on Wireguard which automatically maintains the appropriate routing tables on your macOS.

```bash
# Install via Homebrew
$ brew install chipmk/tap/docker-mac-net-connect

# Run the service and register it to launch at boot
$ sudo brew services start chipmk/tap/docker-mac-net-connect
```

### Using podman on MacOS

The limitation mentioned above, for docker, still applies.
This was tested and applies to podman 5.4 and podman machine running Fedora CoreOS 41.
Running everything with podman requires that the podman machine runs in rootful mode; more details below.

```bash
NAME="Fedora Linux"
VERSION="41.20250215.3.0 (CoreOS)"
RELEASE_TYPE=stable
ID=fedora
VERSION_ID=41
VERSION_CODENAME=""
PLATFORM_ID="platform:f41"
PRETTY_NAME="Fedora CoreOS 41.20250215.3.0"
```

```bash
# we assume no other machines might be running, shutting down the default one
podman machine stop

# we create a new podman machine
# 2-4GiB of memory are unfortunately not enough
# must be rootful
podman machine init --cpus 8 --memory 8192 --rootful ironcore-in-a-box
podman machine start ironcore-in-a-box

# change the default system connection
podman system connection default ironcore-in-a-box-root

# the dp-service requires some extra kernel modules
podman machine ssh ironcore-in-a-box "sudo rpm-ostree install kernel-modules-extra"

# this kernel modules installation requires a restart of the VM
podman machine stop ironcore-in-a-box
podman machine start ironcore-in-a-box

# removing the sch_multiq kernel module from the blacklist
podman machine ssh ironcore-in-a-box grep -rle \"^blacklist sch_multiq\" /etc/modprobe.d/ \| xargs -r sudo sed -i \'s/blacklist sch_multiq/#blacklist sch_multiq/\'
```

## Installation

To set up and start the IronCore stack, run the following command from the root of this repository:

```sh
make up
```


This command will:
1.  Create a local kind cluster (if it doesn't exist).
2.  Deploy the IronCore stack components into the cluster.

## Examples

You can find examples of how to use the IronCore API in the [Examples](examples/) directory. You can spin up a VM in a [VPC / Overlay Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_private_cloud) with a virtual IP. By default, VMs enable password login for easy accessing and testing. The default username and password are `ironcore` and `best123`. Customized ignition can be also generated and used for other purposes.

Your local "datacenter" is at your fingertips to test. Ironcore API documentation can be found [here](https://ironcore-dev.github.io/ironcore/api-reference/overview/) which shows the whole capabilities of IronCore.

## Cleanup

To remove the kind cluster and all deployed resources, run:

```sh
make down
```


This will effectively stop and delete the entire local IronCore environment created by this project.
